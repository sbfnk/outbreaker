			CHANGES IN OUTBREAKER VERSION 1.1-0
NEW FEATURES
	o implementing the published version of the model, with a major
	change in the genetic likelihood and a new procedure for detecting
	genetic outliers and identifying imported cases

	o updated graphics

	o new function get.my to get mutation rates per unit time (and not
	per generation of infection)

	o new function selectChains to select best runs when different
	MCMC converge to different posterior modes

	o possibility of spatial simulation in simOutbreak

	o choice of two mutational models in outbreaker

	o (under development) spatial diffusion model, useable for
	entirely sampled outbreaks

	o added a 38-pages vignette

	o documentation (manpages) updated

	o toyOutbreak has been renamed fakeOutbreak

BUG FIXES
	o no longer limitation of genome sizes to 32768 nucleotides (new
	limit is 2,147,483,648 nucleotides)



			CHANGES IN OUTBREAKER VERSION 1.0-1
BUG FIXES

	o fixed the dependencies with other packages



			CHANGES IN OUTBREAKER VERSION 1.0-0

NEW FEATURES - FIRST RELEASE OF THE PACKAGE

	o implementation of Jombart et al.'s transmission model in
	functions outbreaker and outbreaker.parallel

	o procedures for visualizing and post-processing MCMCs
	(plotChains, transGraph, plotOutbreak, get.tTree, plot.tTree)

	o outbreak simulator (simOutbreak)

	o computation of incidence and effective reproduction numbers from
	posterior trees (get.incid, get.R, get.Rt)
