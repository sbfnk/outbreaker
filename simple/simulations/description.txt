SUMMARY OF THE SIMULATIONS
==========================

Simulations are made by varying different parameters (3 values each), from a base simulation.
In each case (base simulation and variations, 50 replicates are obtained).

Base simulation is:
- R = 1.5
- w generated by gamma (...)
- mu1=0.8e-4 mu2: 0.2e-4 (gamma always fixed to 1/4, genome length always fixed to 10,000)
- rate of imported cases = 0.05 (diverg imported cases always fixed to 20 (10x2) generations from index case)
- % sampled cases = 100%
- % sequenced data = 100%



Values taken by parameters in different variations are:
- R: 1.1, 4
- w generated by gamma with param: (...), (...)
- mu1 = 0, 2e-4
- rate of imported cases: 0, 0.2
- % sampled cases: 25%, 50%, 75%
- % sequenced data: 25%, 50%, 75%



All results will be based on a single run of outbreaker (not the parallel version) with the
following arguments:

init.tree="star", init.kappa=NULL, n.iter=1e5, sample.every=500, tune.every=500,burnin=2e4,
find.import=TRUE, find.import.n=50,pi.param1=10, pi.param2=1,init.mu1=1e-5, init.gamma=1,
move.mut=TRUE, move.ances=TRUE, move.kappa=TRUE

OUTPUTS OF THE SIMULATIONS
==========================
Each simulation produces its own output, including:

1) [name-of-simulation].RData: a RData containing the full outbreak (full), the analysed data (dat),
results of outbreaker (res), the consensus tree with a burnin of 2e4 (tre), and a list of statistics
(stat).

'stat' is a data.frame containing the following information (with a single line):
- prop.ances.ok: the proportion of correct ancestries in the consensus tree
- msup.ances: the mean support (frequency) of the true ancestor in the posterior
- msup.kappa: the mean support (frequency) of the true kappa in the posterior
- msup.date: the mean support (frequency) of the true date of infection in the posterior
- prop.imp.ok: the proportion of successfully detected imported cases
- mu1.ok: 1 if true value of mu1 is in the 95% CI, 0 otherwise
- mu2.ok: 1 if true value of mu2 is in the 95% CI, 0 otherwise
- pi.ok: 1 if true value of mu2 is in the 95% CI, 0 otherwise

2) [name-of-simulation].in.txt: an in file indicating the parameters of the simulation, as a table
with one single row and the following columns:
- R: the R0
- w.mu: the mean used to generate w
- w.sigma: the standard deviation used to generate w
- mu1: rate of transitions
- mu2: rate of transversions
- r.imp.cases: rate of imported cases
- p.obs.cases: the proportion of sampled (observed) cases
- p.seq.data: the proportion of observed cases with genetic sequences

3) [name-of-simulation].out.txt: an output file based on 'stat', as a table with one single row and the
column named after 'stat'.


The name of the simulation ([name-of-simulation]) is coded as 10-characters hash key (SHA-1) based
on the data ('dat').





==========================
OUTPUTS OF ALL SIMULATIONS
==========================
The script 'poolResults' (in poolResults.R) scans all sub-directory looking for '[...].in.txt' and
'[...].out.txt' files, and compile these into a single data.frame. This data.frame is similar to a
cbind of '[...].in.txt' and '[...].out.txt'.

The script returns the pooled data.frame and writes its content to a file 'pooledResults.csv'. The
rows of the data.frame are the 10-characters hash keys.
